# Installing

The following instructions are tried and tested on a ubuntu system,
however I have tried to keep it as generic as possible. The best way to
go about installing is to do the following instructions in order,
starting with:

1. Update your local package index:

```{r, engine='shell', count_lines}
sudo apt-get update
```

2. Upgrade any outdated packages:

```{r, engine='shell', count_lines}
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

## Frontend

### Install Node.js and NPM

1. Install the PPA (Personal Package Archive) for the currently active
    release (the 7.* branch):

```{r, engine='shell', count_lines}
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_7.x | sudo -E bash
```

2. The PPA will be added into your APT configuration, and your local
    package cache will be automatically updated:

```{r, engine='shell', count_lines}
sudo apt-get install nodejs
```

> **Note:** The Node.js package contains the Node.js binary as well as
> **npm**, so you don't need to install **npm** separately. However, in
> order for some **npm** packages to work (such as those that require
> building from source), you will need to install the build-essentials
> package.

3. Install build-essentials:

```{r, engine='shell', count_lines}
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

### Install Front-end Requirements

Navigate into the frontend/ directory and install the dependencies
listed in package.json

```{r, engine='shell', count_lines}
$ cd frontend
$ npm install
```

## Backend

### Installing Python

This project is capable of running with either Python 2 or 3, however
it is highly recommended to stick with Python 3, as Python 2 is used
only as a backup to fall back on.

Note that all Python related commands after this section assume the
command to invoke the Python interpreter is `python`, if that is not
the case on your system then substitute `python` with whatever your
system makes use of. If you are not sure what the python command is
on your system, then sift through the Python 3 and 2 instructions
below, and try each alias followed by the version flag e.g.
`python3 --version`, `python2.7 --version`, etc.

#### Python 3

These instructions are taken from [Python 3 installation docs](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install3/linux/).

1. To see which version of Python 3 you have installed, open a command
    prompt and run:

```{r, engine='shell', count_lines}
$ python3 --version
```

or

```{r, engine='shell', count_lines}
$ python3.6 --version
```

2. Check that the outputted version matches what is listed in
    [runtime.txt]

    > If the major and minor versions do match (i.e. the first two numbers,
    > e.g. 3.6), then you may ignore the remaining Python installation steps.

3. Install Python 3:

..* If using Ubuntu 17.04 or earlier:

```{r, engine='shell', count_lines}
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3.6
```

..* If using another version:

```{r, engine='shell', count_lines}
$ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3.6
```

..* If using a distribution other that Ubuntu, you can install Python 3
    using your distributions package manager (dnf is a stub):

```{r, engine='shell', count_lines}
$ sudo dnf install python3.6
```

4. Invoking Python 3:

..* After installation for Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04, 16.10 and 17.04, you can
    invoke the Python 3.6 interpreter using:

```{r, engine='shell', count_lines}
$ python3.6
```

..* Ubuntu 17.10 comes with Python 3.6 as default. You can use the
    following to invoke it:

```{r, engine='shell', count_lines}
$ python3
```

#### Python 2

These instructions are taken from [Python 2 installation docs](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/linux/).

Most linux distributions come with Python 2.7 out of the box.

1. To see which version of Python 2 you have installed, open a command
    prompt and run:

```{r, engine='shell', count_lines}
$ python --version
```

or

```{r, engine='shell', count_lines}
$ python2 --version
```

or

```{r, engine='shell', count_lines}
$ python2.7 --version
```

2. Check that the outputted version matches what is listed in
    [runtime.txt]

    > If the major and minor versions do match (i.e. the first two numbers,
    > e.g. 2.7), then you may ignore the remaining Python installation steps.

3. Install Python 2 using your distributions package manager (dnf is a
    stub):

```{r, engine='shell', count_lines}
$ sudo dnf install python2
```

#### Setuptools & pip

With [setuptools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools) and
[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/), you can download, install, and
uninstall any Python software, such as those listed in
[requirements.txt].

> Python 2.7.9 and later, and Python 3.4 and later include pip by
> default.

To see if pip is installed, open a command prompt and run:

```{r, engine='shell', count_lines}
$ command -v pip
```

To install pip, follow this [pip installation guide](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/).

Note that on some Linux distributions the pip command is meant for
Python 2, while the pip3 command is meant for Python 3.

```{r, engine='shell', count_lines}
$ command -v pip3
```

#### Pipenv & Virtual Environments

Refer to this [guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/#virtualenvironments-ref)
for using Pythons virtual environment, if you wish to make use of it.

### Install Back-end Requirements

Before any of the Python backend requirements can be installed, in
order for the bccrypt library to work you must first make sure that
the follow libraries are installed, use:

```{r, engine='shell', count_lines}
sudo apt-get install build-essential libffi-dev python-dev
```

All the Python dependencies are located in [requirements.txt]. To
install them, open a command prompt, navigate to the projects root
directory and use:

    > **Note:** The following code is assuming Python 3, if using
    > Python 2 then substitute `pip3` with `pip`.

```{r, engine='shell', count_lines}
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
